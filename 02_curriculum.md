#Code.org vs. BJC Curricula

##Comparisons
1. Both curricula are designed for beginner programmers
2. Both code.org and BJC are project based curricula with projects that increase in complexity over the course of the year
3. Both use block-based coding  (at least in the beginning)
4. In non-programming labs, both use videos to teach content

##Contrasts
1. Code.org's "block based" programs are actually modular text based, so they do include typing elements
2. BJC has students programming in a separate website while code.org's IDE is embedded in their website
3. Code.org's student responses are recorded and submitted through their website; BJC requires some type of external document to be created if the teacher wants to collect responses and code
4. In particular, code.org's internet unit is much more interactive
